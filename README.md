Project Description

Creating the Climate Change Awareness web application has been a rewarding experience that has offered valuable insights into both the development process and the importance of environmental advocacy.

Technical Challenges:

Integration of Diverse Technologies: Combining React with ruby on rails required careful planning and implementation to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend. Handling asynchronous operations and managing state across different components were particularly challenging.
Responsive Design: Ensuring that the application was accessible and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes involved meticulous CSS work and testing.


Inspiration
The inspiration for creating a climate awareness website stems from the urgent need to address the global climate crisis and the belief that education and community action can drive significant change.Some key motivations were:

Increasing Climate Change Awareness
Promoting Sustainable Practices
Harnessing Technology for Good

How we built it:

Research: Extensive research was conducted to gather information about climate change, its impacts, and best practices for sustainable living.
Design: Emphasis was placed on ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience. We designed the navigation to be straightforward, with clear pathways to different sections of the site.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: React was chosen for its efficiency in building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Backend: Ruby on rails

Challenges we ran into:

Using github as a group: It was hard challenge to get used to
github and setting different branches for our componenets and we definitely had a fair share of merging issues.
Integrating backend with frontend: This task was really difficult as this is our first time
using ruby on rails as our backend.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

User Interface: We created a nice looking User interface even though that my team and I have little to no experience in building a website with react.
Carbon Footprint Calculator: We are also prond of how our carbon footprint calculator
functionality has worked out.
